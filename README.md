# What is PackPBO
PackPBO is basicly a "Addon Builder" for DayZ. </br> 
it pretty much does the same as Addon Builder only that it does some extra checks.

For example it makes sure that all .png's are converted into .paa on build, it can also automaticly sign signatures. 
And we are hoping to add more features like syntax checking.
